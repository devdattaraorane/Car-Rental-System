# 🚗 Car Rental System

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Car Rental System**! This is a simple and interactive Java-based console application that allows users to rent and return cars. It manages the availability of cars, tracks customer information, and calculates rental prices—all while leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles! 

📦 **Key Concepts**: Classes, Inheritance, Encapsulation, and more!

## ✨ Features
- 🛒 **Rent a Car**: Browse available cars, choose one, and rent it for a specified number of days.
- 🔄 **Return a Car**: Return a rented car and make it available for other customers.
- 🚗 **Car Inventory Management**: Dynamically manage the car list, including details like brand, model, and daily rental price.
- 💵 **Automatic Price Calculation**: Calculate the total rental cost based on the number of days the car is rented.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java ☕
- **Core Concepts**: OOP (Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation)
- **Data Structures**: `ArrayList` for managing cars, customers, and rentals.
- **I/O**: Standard Java input/output (`Scanner` for user interaction)

## 💻 How to Run the Project
1. **Clone or Download** this repository.  
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or compile it using the terminal.
3. Run the `Main` class to launch the console-based Car Rental System.
4. Follow the intuitive on-screen menu to rent or return a car!

### Running via Terminal/Command Line:
1. Navigate to the project folder.
2. Compile the code using:
   
   javac Main.java
   
3. Run the program with:
   
   java Main


## 📂 Project Structure
- **`Car`**: 🚗 Represents a car with details like ID, brand, model, and price per day.
- **`Customer`**: 👤 Stores customer details like ID and name.
- **`Rental`**: 📄 Tracks which car is rented by which customer and for how many days.
- **`CarRentalSystem`**: 🏢 Manages all operations including car renting, returning, and customer information.
- **`Main`**: 🎬 The starting point of the application where cars are added and the system menu is launched.

## 🎮 How to Use
### Rent a Car:
1. Enter your name.
2. Select a car from the available list (displayed by ID, brand, and model).
3. Enter the number of days you want to rent it for.
4. Confirm the rental, and voilà, the car is yours for the rental period! 🚗💨

### Return a Car:
1. Enter the car ID.
2. Return the car and free it up for others to rent. Easy-peasy! 😊

## 🛠️ Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)
- 💾 Add a database to persist rental and customer data.
- 🔒 Implement a login system for customers.
- 🔍 Add search and filter options to make finding cars even easier.
- 🎨 Create a GUI using JavaFX or Swing for a more modern experience.
